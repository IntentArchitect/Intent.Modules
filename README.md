# Intent Architect

Intent Architect is a coding automation tool for software developers. It's based on the principles of a software factory, and provides a platform for design an pattern reuse.
  - **Build Faster** - Allow Intent Architect to manage the tedious and repetitive tasks that take up most of your time, freeing you up to focus on meaningful value-adding development.
  - **Quality Assured** - Create your patterns and rest easy knowing that they are consistently rolled out throughout your codebase.
  - **Agile Architecture** - Future-proof your architecture! Effortlessly upgrade or even swap out your technologies and design patterns at the push of a button. Mitigating technical risk has never been easier.

## How it works
Intent Architect works by feeding information (Metadata) about the application, and how this information should be realized (Modules), into a Software Factory, which then outputs code into your codebase. For more information, check out our website [www.intentarchitect.com](https://intentarchitect.com).

## Create your own Modules
Modules are made up of a cohesive set of outputs which make up a pattern. This repository contains the modules that have been created by the Intent Architect team to deliver complex business applications for existing clients.

While the output of each module is language agnostic, creating the modules must be done using C# and .NET (a modern and powerful strongly typed language).

Tutorials and documentation for creating your own modules is on the way, but in the meantime feel free to check out our existing modules to see how they work.
