If I use Intent Architect am I locked into your product ?

How do I create my own patterns / modules ?

Do I need to use T4 templates for my patterns ?

Does my solution need to be Microsoft .Net based ? 

Isn't code generation fundamentally evil ?

Does this tool replace traditional software development ?

 Intent Architect also directly addresses many of the issues inherent with traditional code generation tools. Intent Architect operates completely at design time and as a result has no lock-in, it simply writes the code you want it to write, how you want it to write it. It's important to note that Intent Architect is build by developers, for developers, we are in no way trying to diminish the development experience. This tool allows developers to better capture our design intent as developers rather than hard coding it into our applications.
