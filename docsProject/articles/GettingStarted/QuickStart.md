# Quick Start

It takes just a few minutes to get a feel for the power of Intent Architect. For this quickstart we're going to create a "full stack" ASP.NET WebApi 2.2 server with persistence and domain patterns in place. If you haven't done so already, install the latest release and sign in to application using the credentials used for registration. Once signed in, in the application:

## Download the application

## Register on the website

## Create a new Solution

## Create a new Application

## Push the "Play" button

## What just happened


Press 'Create New Solution' directly under the 'Start' heading at the top left of the initial screen.
You are now on the screen for managing your new solution, press the 'New Application' tile.
Select the 'Full Stack ASP.NET WebApi 2.2' tile and press the 'Next' button.
Keep the default application 'Name' or change it, then press 'Create'.
Give the application a short while to download and install the modules.
Press the icon with a play button at the top right of the UI to run the software factory.
After the software factory execution is complete, you are presented with a list of all pending changes, press the 'Apply' button for the outputs to be written to your disk drive.
You've now created the scaffolding code for a Visual Studio server solution, as well as installed all the required NuGet packages.

Open the solution in Visual Studio 2015/2017 (output will be in the location chosen for your application)
Compile and run (hit F5)
Play around in Intent Architect by adding Services, Domain classes and DTOs, and see how the patterns are realized in your codebase.
