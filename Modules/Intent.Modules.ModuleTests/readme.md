# Tests for Intent Modules

This folder contains and Intent solution and its output.

## EfEntityGenerationTests
The Intent Solution has a domain modelled with an exhaustive combination of relationships/associations between entities. The software factory can then be run against this intent application and the output reviewed to make sure its correct in terms of the EF mappings that are generated.

Also see issue [#163](https://github.com/IntentSoftware/IntentArchitect/issues/163) for additional context.
