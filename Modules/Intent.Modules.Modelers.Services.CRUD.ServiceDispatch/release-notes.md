### Version 3.4.0

- New: Now DTOs will include fields of mapped Entities' inheritance hierarchies.
- Update: Ported the logic from MediatR's CRUD script to this one to bring it up to par with mapping and new DTO creation (nested compositional CRUD support not yet).

### Version 3.3.9

- Fixed: `Create` operation generated by the CRUD script did not have a return type.

### Version 3.3.8

- Update: Refactored the CRUD script so that it is easier to read and to follow.

### Version 3.3.7

- New: CRUD Creation scripts now automatically return the surrogate key type in the create operation if it is not a composite key. This will return the Entity's ID on creation. Explicit and Implicit keys are respected.
- New: Those surrogate key types will be automatically wrapped in a `application/json` wrapper object to aid clients consuming that service operation with parsing valid JSON.
