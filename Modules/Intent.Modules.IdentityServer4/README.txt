INTENT ARCHITECT - MODULE BUILDER

To compile and run this module in Intent Architect, the following steps are required:

NOTE: In Visual Studio, it is recommended to use a T4 editor such as this one (https://t4-editor.tangible-engineering.com) to edit T4 templates.

# 1. Build Module
    - In Visual Studio, click Build -> Transform all T4 templates 
      NOTE: If the option is not available in Visual Studio, the T4 can be generated by saving each file individually.
            Alternatively, to enable this menu option, see the following solution on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18258198/visual-studio-shortcut-for-building-all-t4-in-solution)
    - Complile this project by clicking Build -> Build Solution. 
    - This will automatically package and create an Intent Module (.imod) file in the ${SolutionFolder}/Intent.Modules folder.

# 2. Add repository to Intent Architect
    - In Intent Architect, navigate to the application you wish to install this module into.
    - Navigate to the Modules section
    - Click the Repository Setting cog in the top right corner of the Modules section.
    - Click Add New, and specify the Name (e.g. Local Modules) and Address which will be the full (or relative) path to the ${SolutionFolder}/Intent.Modules folder.
      TIP: for the current workspace, this will be at the following relative location (copy directly into your repository location): 
      ./IdentityServer4/Intent.Modules 
    - Click Save

#3. Install Module
    - Select your newly added module repository from the Repository dropdown.
    - Your module will automatically be loaded into the modules view.
    - Click on your module and then click Install in the details section on the right.

#4. Run the Software Factory
    - Click the "play" button in the right of the navigation bar to run the Software Factory.
    - Outputs (if any) for your module will be listed. 
    - Errors can be debugged by clicking on the "bug" button to left of the "play" button, and selecting this solution.
