<div>
    <p>A full technology stack for building a web server using ASP.NET WebApi 2.2 in Visual Studio.</p>
    <p>This template configures an N-Layered architecture with a rich domain based on Domain Driven Development (DDD) principles.</p>
    <p>The following technologies are used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ASP.NET WebApi 2.2</strong> - framework for building HTTP services</li>
        <li><strong>OWIN</strong> - middleware framework between the web server and web application</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Framework</strong> - Microsoft's recommended ORM (Object Relational Mapper), providing an abstraction on the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity</strong> - dependency injection framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Service calls are implemented using a lazy dispatch pattern which is abstracted away from the WebApi technology and technical concernts.
            Your service call business code should be implemented in the 'SCH' classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            A collection oriented repository pattern provides access to the udnerlying database via Entity Framework.
            The DbContext backing each repository is isolated to each service call. The same instance is returned for any instantiation of a repository during the service call.
        </li>
        <!--<li>
            A rich domain pattern realizes classes described in the Domain. By design, altering entities is isolated to Operations on the entities (i.e. changing attributes on
            an entity via is Setter is made more difficult).
        </li>-->
        <li>
            Dependency injection is implemented throughout each pattern in the application. Add additional registrations in thte UnityConfig.cs file.
        </li>
    </ul>
