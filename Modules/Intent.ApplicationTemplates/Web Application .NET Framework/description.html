    <p>A full technology stack for building a web server using ASP.NET WebApi 2.2 in Visual Studio.</p>
    <!--<p>This template configures a hexagonal architecture with a technology agnostic Domain and Application layer.</p>-->
    <!--<p>The following technologies are used:</p>-->
    <!--<ul>
        <li><strong>ASP.NET WebApi 2.2</strong> - framework for building HTTP services</li>
        <li><strong>OWIN</strong> - middleware framework between the web server and web application</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Framework</strong> - Microsoft's recommended ORM (Object Relational Mapper), providing an abstraction on the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity</strong> - dependency injection framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Service Calls</strong> - Service calls are implemented using a lazy dispatch pattern which is abstracted away from the WebApi technology and technical concernts.
            Your service call business code should be implemented in the 'SCH' classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Repository Pattern</strong> - A collection oriented repository pattern provides access to the underlying database via Entity Framework.
            The DbContext backing each repository is isolated to each service call. The same instance is returned for any instantiation of a repository during the service call.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> - Dependency injection is implemented throughout each pattern in the application. A per-service-call Lifetime manager is used to ensure all respositories
            instantiated during a call receive the same DbContext.
            Add additional registrations in thte UnityConfig.cs file.
        </li>
    </ul>-->
