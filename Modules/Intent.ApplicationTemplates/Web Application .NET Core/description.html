    <p>A full technology stack for building a web server using ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio 2017+.</p>
    <p>This template configures a hexagonal architecture with a technology agnostic Domain and Application layer.</p>
    <p>The following technologies are used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> - framework for building HTTP services</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Framework Core</strong> - Microsoft's recommended ORM (Object Relational Mapper), providing an abstraction on the database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other notes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Service Calls</strong> - Service calls are implemented using a lazy dispatch pattern which is abstracted away from the WebApi technology and technical concernts.
            Your service call business code should be implemented in the 'SCH' classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Repository Pattern</strong> - A collection oriented repository pattern provides access to the underlying database via Entity Framework.
            The DbContext backing each repository is isolated to each service call. The same instance is returned for any instantiation of a repository during the service call.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dependency Injection</strong> - Dependency injection is implemented using the standard ASP.NET Core DI container.
        </li>
    </ul>
