### Version 3.3.7

- Attribute naming conventions (i.e. pascal-case vs camel-case) moved to Domain Settings (see settings panel).

### Version 3.3.6

- Fixed: When referenced in the `Module Builder` the Software Factory was updating `.csproj` files to reference version `3.3.6` of the NuGet Package which did not exist.
