### Version 3.3.19

- `UseType` and `GetTypeName` can now disambiguate types by additional qualification when it identifies that a type with a matching name exists for more than one namespace which is present in a file's using directives. This can only be done for types which are generated by templates.
- Improved the logic of the `CSharpResolvedTypeInfo.Create` method.

### Version 3.3.18

- Fixed: Non-first generic type parameters were not being normalized. For example `Dictionary<System.String, System.String>` should have been normalized to `Dictionary<String, String>` but was incorrectly normalized to `Dictionary<String, System.String>`.

### Version 3.3.17

 - Builder pattern for templating C# files (see type `Intent.Modules.Common.CSharp.Builder.CSharpFile`). 
	Note that this is an experimental templating pattern and, if used, one should expect changes to the API in future releases.
	An example of this templating approach can be found in the `Intent.Modules.ValueObjects` module in the `Intent.Modules.NET` open-source repository.
