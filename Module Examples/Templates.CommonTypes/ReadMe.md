# Templates : Common Types

The Intent Common Types Modules provides technology independent types to use in your modelling, these types support language specific types through stereotypes.
These examples help familiarize you with the concepts of this module.  

## Concepts shown
- Type agnostic modelling, model with technology independent types and have your templates realize these models with the technology appropriate types. 
- Making your type resolution aware of generated types.
- Creating your own type resolver to support other coding languages.

## Agnostic Types CSharp Template

This template illustrates generating a C# class using the technology independent types, note how they are translated to C# specific types.

## Agnostic Types TypeScript Template

This template illustrates generating a TypeScript class using the technology independent types, note how they are translated to TypeScript specific types. This template is using the exact same UML model as the C# template, yet the types are rendered to TypeScript specific types.
