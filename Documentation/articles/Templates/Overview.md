# Template Overview

A template, simply put, is an artifact which generates code. These templates are how you instruct Intent Architect to build your application's source code.  

An Intent Architect template is comprised, logically, of five parts
- **[The template class](TheTemplateClass.md)**, your template class.    
- **[Registration](Registrations.md)**, letting Intent Architect know about your template and how to bind data to it.    
- **[Configuration](Registrations.md)**, making your template configurable.    
- **[Code output](Registrations.md)**, the actual code generation process.    
- **[Extensions](Registrations.md)**, built in or extension features which your templates can leverage to enrich or enhance the code generation process.
