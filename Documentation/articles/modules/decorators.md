# Decorators
Decorators provide the mechanism to extend a template in ways that it supports. The template will provide hook points for the Decorator to inject code or provide logic. They are typically used when modules are being designed in a generic fashion for use across different software development projects.

Explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IntentSoftware/IntentArchitect) for examples of Decorators that are used in the modules created by the Intent Architect team.
