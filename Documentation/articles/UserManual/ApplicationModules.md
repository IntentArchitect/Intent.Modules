# Application Modules

This screen allows to manage which modules are installed for your application. These modules are typically your packaged patterns, i.e. templates generating your code , the way you want it, using your meta data. Modules typically should be a set of templates to achieve a pattern or set of related patterns. Modules often encapsulate a technology, and more specifically your usage patterns of the specific technology. Modules are discovered through repositories which can be either service based or folder based.

It is important to note that modules can contain more than just patternized code generation, some other types of modules might include IDE Integration, Code Weavers or Meta Data providers.

Modules can include any of the following plugins:- 

|Plugin Type|Description|
|-|-|
|Template Registrations|Standard code generation plugins namely templates and decorators.|
|Factory Extensions|Allow for the execution of custom code within the software factory. |
|Meta Data Provider|Load your own Meta Data to further enrich the code generation process. |
